1. Assuming that IQ is normally distributed with a population mean of 100 and a population standard deviation of 15, describe completely the sampling distribution of the mean for a sample size equal to 20 (i.e., its mean, standard deviation, and shape).

2. Can repressed anger lead to higher blood pressure? In a hypothetical study, 16 college students with very high repressed anger scores (derived from a series of questionnaires taken in an introductory psychology class) are called in to have their blood pressure measured. The mean systolic blood pressure for this sample ($\bar{X}$) is 124 mmHg. If the mean systolic blood pressure for the population is 120 with a standard deviation of 10, can you conclude that repressed anger is associated with higher blood pressure? Use $\alpha$ = 0.05 and conduct a two-tailed test. Show all steps of null hypothesis significance testing as we have done in class, and interpret your results in the context of the research question.

3. Imagine that you are testing a new drug that seems to raise the number of T cells in the blood and therefore has enormous potential for the treatment of disease. After treating 100 patients, you find that their mean ($\bar{X}$) T cell count is 29.1. Assume that $\mu$ and $\sigma$ (hypothetically) are 28 and 6, respectively.

    a. Test the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level, two-tailed.
  
    b. Test the same hypothesis at the $\alpha$ = 0.1 level, two-tailed. (You only need to state what is different.)
  
    c. Describe in practical terms what it would mean to commit a Type I error in this example.
  
    d. Describe in practical terms what it would mean to commit a Type II error in this example.
  
    e. How might you justify the use of $\alpha$ = 0.1 in similar experiments?
  
4. Assuming everything else in the previous problem stayed the same, what would happen to our calculated $z$ if the population standard deviation ($\sigma$) were 3 instead of 6? What general statement can you make about how changes in $\sigma$ affect the calculated value of $z$?

5. Referring to #4, suppose that $\bar{X}$ is equal to 29.1 regardless of the sample size. How large would $n$ have to be for the calculated $z$ to be statistically significant at the 0.01 level (two-tailed)?

6. A psychologist would like to know how many casual friends are in the average person's social network. She interviews a random sample of people and determines for each the number of friends or social acquaintances they see or talk to at least once a year. The data are as follows: 5, 11, 15, 9, 7, 13, 23, 8, 12, 7, 10, 11, 21, 20, 13. (To save you time, $\bar{X}$ = 12.33 and $s$ = 5.38.)

    a. Test the null hypothesis that the sample is a random selection from the general population where $\mu$ = 5. Use $\alpha$ = 0.05 and conduct a two-tailed test, showing all the steps.
