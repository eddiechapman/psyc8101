1. A researcher is interested in assessing the effectiveness of a prenatal care intervention on newborns' birthweights. Adolecent pregnant women - who tend to have infants of lower birthweight - are identified and invited to participate in an experiement. Those ho wish to participate are randomly assigned to one of two groups: a control group or an experimental group. Women in the experimental group participate in the prenatal care program, whereas women in the control group do not. After their babies were bron, the following data were collected (DV = Newborn's birthweight in lbs):

  \[\begin{tabular}{||c c||}
      \hline
      Experimental Group & Control Group \\ [0.5ex] 
      \hline
      \hline
      540 & 570 \\ 
      \hline
      510 & 520 \\
      \hline
      580 & 600 \\
      \hline
      550 & 530 \\
      \hline
      520 & 520 \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}\]
